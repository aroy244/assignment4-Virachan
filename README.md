# A9501 Assignment 4

This assignment is to submit a proposal for your capstone project (described as Assignment 5) and to provide feedback on two other proposals.  The proposal should be submitted as a markdown file in a GitHub repository and should include links to any relevant background material and/or documentation. The proposal should be between 500 and 1000 words long; think of it as the draft of the README file for the project.
 

Feedback should comment on: 

* project scope (too big or too small?) 
* feasibility (does the project require specialized libraries or other resources that might be difficult to get?) 
* justification (did the proposal explain how and to whom the results of the project will be useful?)
